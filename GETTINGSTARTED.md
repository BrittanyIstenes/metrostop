# Getting Started Processes

Whenever a person wants to contribute back or consume a project, it is crucial to have a clear getting started guide.  This ensures that the project has a low barrier for entry which in turn leads to success for the engineering team. 

## How to create a low barrier for entry


- Start up a Teams channel for your project to create a continuous loop of communication between the project team and the external contributors/consumers
- Label issues with `good-first-issue`
- [Create issues, feature requests, and pull request templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html) stating how your team wants all requests to be filled and each including an `innersource` label to be automatically added when published 
- Include Whatever a contributor might need to get the app up and running before coding 
- Can be filled in by an intern or some contributors gets started based on feedback about what would have been helpful to get them started  
- List out who reviews the documentation
